# Orchard
Tool for building timelines, family trees, and more.

Goal is to allow for the construction of time dependant data visualizations, with the ability to display information conditionally.
For example, in the case of constructing a time line: can control the date ranges across which information is displayed.
Not only that, but depending on the selected time range, information within specific nodes may change. 
This feature was initially intended for filtering out spoilers: if an event happens in episode 3, but the ramifications only become evident in episode 6, the entry (node) for episode 3 will display different information depending on if the time range includes episode 6 or not.


End goals include a rendering engine to display constructs, XML file upload and download, along with terminal I/O.
